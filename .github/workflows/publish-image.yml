###############################################################################
# This workflow deploys an image to the GitHub Container Registry using Actions.
# It specifies a minimal set of permissions -- access to the repo, the ability
# to write packages, and the ability to write an ID token to complete the
# identity challenge with [sigstore/fulcio](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio).
#
# The current repository will also be used to host the image.
